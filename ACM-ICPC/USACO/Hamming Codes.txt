There are only a few tools we need to solve this problem. First of all, we can use basic techniques to find the Nth bit of a number M: counting the least significant bit as bit 0, the next bit as bit 1, etc., we can find the value of that bit through the expression 

          int Nth_bit = (1 << N) & M;

In other words, we are shifting the number 1 left by N spaces, and then performing a binary AND on the resulting number with our original number, which will leave either a 1 in the Nth bit or a 0. So the first thing we have to do is find out the distance between each pair of numbers within the set of all numbers with B bits (0..2B-1). 
We also know that 0 can be one of the numbers in the set, because if the minimum number in the set were N instead of 0, we could XOR N to each number in the set and they would still be the same distance apart. The limits on the problem are low enough that we can do a DFS, and as soon as we hit a solution we can output it and exit.
